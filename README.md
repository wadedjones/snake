### SNAKE

This is my first attempt at Snake.
Collision is a little shaky.
The speed is directly tied to FPS which seems weird and I don't know how to change it yet.
It's late and I'm tired so the scoring doesn't quite make sense.
Refactoring is needed. Game state is held inside the snake struct which makes no sense.
